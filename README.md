A simple RTÉ News reader for Ubuntu Touch.
Takes the xml feed from <http://www.rte.ie/news/rss/news-headlines.xml> and displays it in an Ubuntu touch QML app.

Unfortunatly RTÉ don't give the full text of articles in their xml feed.

Following the tutorial from MHall <http://mhall119.com/2013/04/building-an-ubuntu-sdk-app-rev-1/>

And the tutorial from the Qt Project <http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/demos-declarative-rssnews.html>

Work in progress of course.
